Protection of Secretless Broker credential resolution is based on industry-standard practices of keeping the data for the minimal duration needed and hardening of the execution environment. This is ensured by various strategies listed below.

## Hardened container

### Limited User

Our Docker container not only runs within an isolated Docker environment but it also runs within a limited-user context. This ensures a layered system of proven SECCOMP kernel security on top of Linux standard user privilege context limitations.

### Minimal Container Runtime

Our container is also based on [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) which has an extremely limited amount of built-in tools, making it much harder for malware to operate in such an environment. Combined with the limited-user scope, the processes within this environment are unable to add additional packages to the container without circumventing Linux ["ring 3"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_ring) isolation.

## Minimal Credential Retention

One of the most significant security risks caused by an application occurs when credentials persist longer than they are needed. Secretless Broker centralizes the credential management functionality so that the application no longer has to manage secret values and in doing so, ensures that credentials are stored in memory for the minimal amount of time needed to open a new connection. Each Listener/Handler combination is responsible for its own credential lifecycle.

Here are summaries of the credential lifecycles for each of the built-in listeners:

- `http`: Listener fetches the credentials on each request and they are stored only for the duration of an individual connection authentication, after which they are zeroized.
- `mysql`: Credentials are loaded for each connection and then garbage-collected after connecting to the backend.
- `pg`: Credentials are loaded for each connection and then garbage-collected after connecting to the backend.
- `ssh`: Loaded on each new ssh connection and only stored for the duration of the indvidual connection.
- `ssh-agent`: Loaded at Listener instantiation time.

## Hardened Networking

You can use both `localhost` listening address and/or socket files to exchange information between the applications and the
Secretless Broker which provide a communication channel that does not leave the host/pod. By having an isolated communication
channel between them, you can limit access to the Secretless Broker in a granular way. Additionally,
more security layers can be added to this system (e.g. [encrypted overlay network](https://docs.docker.com/network/overlay/#create-an-overlay-network),
Kubernetes pod collocation, etc) for improvement. Since these additional improvements are specific to individual
infrastructure deployments, they are currently outside the scope of this document.

Regardless of the connection strategy, the operating system provides security between the client and Secretless.
It is _very_ important to configure the OS properly so that unauthorized processes and clients canâ€™t connect to Secretless:

- With Unix domain sockets, operating system file permissions should be used to protect the socket.
- With TCP connections, Secretless should be configured to listen only on localhost.

## Future Work

We continue to investigate ways to make Secretless Broker even more secure. Please check the [changelog](https://github.com/cyberark/secretless-broker) and this page for updates on additional safeguards as we implement them.

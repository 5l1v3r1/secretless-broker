# Overview

Secretless is a connection broker which relieves client applications of the need
to directly handle secrets to target services such as databases, web services, SSH
connections, or any other TCP-based service.

In this section of the documentation, we will provide the motivation for
[why you should use Secretless](/docs.html), talk about [how it works](/how_it_works.html),
and define some [key terms](/key_terms.html).
